=========

This is a collection of libraries that I use for my projects.

* Some are things I have been unable to find in standard libraries.
* There is a ground "short" for connecting ground points (like in a star)

Also included is a parts db used for generating BOMs with Bom-ex. Makes it very easy to place an order with Digikey, Mouser, Allied, etc.
